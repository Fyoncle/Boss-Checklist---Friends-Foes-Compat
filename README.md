This simple mod adds [Friends&Foes](https://modrinth.com/mod/friends-and-foes) compatibility to [Boss Checklist](https://modrinth.com/mod/boss-checklist).

- Q: Why is it a mod rather than a datapack?
  - A: Because Boss Checklist requires both a resourcepack and a datapack. Datapacks can't contain resourcepacks so the easiest way to get both is by loading a mod that has both in it.
